                In this proposal, we talk about how we utilized data science and machine learning to analyze, prevent and predict system errors in a dental milling device. 
                  The total market size estimated for the dental milling industry is close to $3billion+. 
                  Based on estimates by the World Health Organization, oral diseases affect close to 3.5 billion people worldwide. 
                  Often times these machines have a high cost of manufacturing and the unfavorable reimbursement policy hinders the customer experience. 
                  In this scenario, using data science/machine learning/artificial intelligence for predictive maintenance is absolutely critical. 
                  Based on years of data accumulated, we built systems that are capable of analyzing, preventing, and predicting system errors commonly found in a dental lab milling workflow. 
                  We show how we utilized state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques and Classification algorithms to build a system that is able to analyze, prevent and predict system errors. 
                  We show how we efficiently applied data science techniques to aid in value generation and how we utilized state-of-the-art techniques in a manner that was applicable to a business problem. 
                  This talk is suitable for the general data science community and particularly data scientists/machine learning engineers interested to see how data science can efficiently be applied in a Computed Aided Manufacturing industry to yield favorable business outcomes.
